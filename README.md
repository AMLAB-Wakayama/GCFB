Gammchirp auditory filterbank [1]  
See ReadmeFirst.m in the individual directory.  

Packages:  
* GCFBv211pack:  Dec 2018 version  
	- Sample-by-sample processing in the caluculation.  
	- It was used in the original GEDI/mrGEDI.  
  
* GCFBv221pack:  May 2020 version   
	- Frame-based processing was introduced.   
	       It is much faster than the GCFBv211 (about 40 to 100 times)  
	       when producing frame-wise auditory spectrogram.  
	- You may choose "frame-based" or "sample-by-sample" processing.  
	- It is used in the frame-based mrGEDI.  
  
* GCFBv231:  Nov 2021 version [2]  --> New algorithm
	- Absolute threshold and hearing loss (HL) were introduced.  
    	- It works only with frame-based processing.  
	- "Sample-by-sample" processing is not much changed from v211. 
	- This version is essential for hearing impairment simulator, WHISv300.

Programs  (GCFBv231 and probably applicable for the latest version): 
  
- testGCFBv231.m :   test / example program. Execute this program first.  
  
- StartupGCFB.m :  Path setting. Execute this if necessary.  


- GCFBv231.m : main body  
	- Important functions and parameters (default)
	  - Eqlz2MeddisHCLevel.m  : input level control for simplicity. You may specify SPL more strictly.
	  - GCparam.OutMidCrct = 'FreeField'; % Sound source/position selection  
	  - GCparam.Ctrl = 'dynamic';    
	  - GCparam.DynHPAF.StrPrc = 'frame-base';  
	- Hearing loss (HL) parameters  
	  - GCparam.HLoss.Type = 'NH';   % normal hearing  
      - GCparam.HLoss.Type = 'HL0'; % manual setting  
	       Example of setting:  GCparam.HLoss.HearingLeveldB = [ 5  5  6  7 12 28 39] +5;  % HL4+5dB   
      - GCparam.HLoss.Type = 'HL1' ~ 'HL8' % various types of example hearing loss   
	  - See GCFBv231_HearingLoss.m (lines 200-240) for detail   
   
- GCFBv231_EnvModLoss.m :  Envelop modulation (TMTF) loss calculation (beta version)  
	 
- GCFBv231_AnaEnvMod.m :  Modulation filterbank calculation (beta version)  
	  
- ShowIOfunction_ExctPtn_GCFBv231.m :  Show Input-output function based on excitation pattern  
  
- ShowIOfunction_AsymFunc_GCFBv231.m :  Show Input-output function by Asymmetric Function   
  
- There are some other programs to show the characteristics of GCFB.
